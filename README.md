📌 Key Concepts
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and prepare the dataset.

Standardization: Scale features for better clustering.

K-Means Clustering: Identify customer groups.

PCA Visualization: Plot clusters in 2D for easy interpretation.

📈 Visual Output
Elbow Method to find optimal number of clusters.

Scatter Plots for cluster visualization.

Cluster Summary using group statistics.

🧠 Insights & Recommendations
Each cluster reveals unique customer traits:

High spenders with low income

Low spenders with high income

Average spenders, etc.

These insights help businesses:

Run targeted ads

Personalize recommendations

Improve customer retention

📚 Learning Outcomes
